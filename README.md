# rebase-your-face

> A highly unstable, emotionally volatile Git playground where best practices go to die.  
> Built to test, break, and rebuild — because if you can untangle *this*, you can handle anything.

## ❓ What is this?

This repo isn’t here to impress.  
It’s a controlled Git disaster zone — a proving ground for rebasing, resetting, and recovering from the kind of mistakes you'd never admit to in a code review.  

No hand-holding. No rules. Just raw, unfiltered version control chaos.

## ⚙️ Why?

- To test if Git is truly as powerful as it claims.  
- To weaponize `rebase`, master `reflog`, and stare into the abyss of merge hell until it blinks.  
- To understand Git not by reading, but by surviving.

## 💀 What You'll Face

- Branches with no origin story.
- Conflicts that defy logic.
- Histories rewritten beyond recognition.
- Commits that raise more questions than answers.

Every push is a gamble. Every pull is a challenge.  
You’ll learn not just to use Git — but to **bend it**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/curtainteddt/rebaseyourface.git
cd rebaseyourface
```

Then:

- Create a branch with your username then treat it as `main` branch.
- Wreck the commit history.
- Rebase until you hallucinate.
- Recover it all like nothing happened.

No tutorials. No structure. Figure it out.

## 💡 You’ll Actually Learn

- `git rebase --interactive`
- `git reflog` (your last line of defense)
- `git cherry-pick` (surgical precision)
- `git reset --hard` (burn it down)
- `git merge` with actual strategy

## 🧨 Examples of Commit Messages

- `rewrite history`
- `not proud of this one`
- `survived the rebase`
- `headless but hopeful`

## 🪦 Disclaimer

This repo is not safe, sane, or standardized.  
It exists for one reason: to make you **unreasonably good** at Git by walking through fire and versioning hell.

If you mess up, good.  
Now fix it.

**Welcome to Git the hard way.**
